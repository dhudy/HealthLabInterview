# HealthLabInterview

This repository consists of two applications that run side-by-side: the first is a web API and the second is a web app that consumes the API. This template has both applications set up with an example related to weather forecasts. Use the example to familiarize yourself with the flow of data from one application to the other. 

The theme of the project is a Patient Questionnaire System. When you go to a doctor you are usually handed paperwork to fill out in the waiting room. Different offices collect different information but the goal of this project is to digitize this data. This is a common healthcare problem that has been solved by nearly every electronic health record system. So no code you write will be utilized by us in any way except to help determine a qualified candidate.

Please use the issue tracker to view the project requirements and determine what you will need to code. We do not want anyone to complete all of the issues. You can decide which issues youâ€™d like to tackle. There are no right or wrong answers but be prepared to explain your decision-making process. This project is open book and internet but please work alone.

Good luck!
